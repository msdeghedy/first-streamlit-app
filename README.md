### 1. The Problem Statement

A telecom company is experiencing a high rate of customer churn, which is impacting revenue. The goal of this project was to analyze their customer data to identify the key drivers of churn and provide actionable recommendations to improve customer retention.

### 2. My Solution: An Interactive Dashboard

To solve this problem, I built an interactive dashboard using Streamlit. This tool allows business leaders to:

* Explore churn patterns in real-time.
* Filter the data by customer segments like contract type, internet service, and tenure.
* Drill down into the specific reasons customers are leaving.

### 3. Key Analytical Insights

The analysis revealed three key insights that tell a clear story:

* **Insight #1: The problem is concentrated in two main groups.** Customers on **Month-to-Month contracts** and those with **Fiber Optic** internet service both churn at a rate of over 40%.
* **Insight #2: Price is not the issue, value is.** A deeper dive into the Fiber Optic group revealed that customers who churned were often paying *less* than the customers who stayed, suggesting an issue with "value for money."
* **Insight #3: The entry-level plan is failing.** The problem is most severe for customers on the cheapest, **low-tier Fiber Optic plans**. This group has an unsustainable churn rate of over **62%**.

### 4. Recommendations for the Business

Based on these insights, I have two data-backed recommendations:

* **Recommendation #1: Re-evaluate the entry-level Fiber Optic plan.** The business needs to investigate why this plan is uncompetitive. A market analysis of competitor offers at this price point is crucial.
* **Recommendation #2: Develop a targeted retention campaign.** The company should proactively target high-risk customers (Month-to-month and low-tier Fiber Optic) with incentives to switch to more stable yearly contracts.

### 5. Data Source

* The dataset used is the **"Telco Customer Churn"** dataset from IBM, available on Kaggle: [Link to Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yeanzc/telco-customer-churn-ibm-dataset)
