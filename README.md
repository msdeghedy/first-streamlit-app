Telco Customer Churn Analysis & Interactive Dashboard
1. The Problem Statement
A telecom company is experiencing a high rate of customer churn, which is impacting revenue. The goal of this project was to analyze their customer data to identify the key drivers of churn and provide actionable recommendations to improve customer retention.

2. My Solution: An Interactive Dashboard
To solve this problem, I built an interactive dashboard using Streamlit. This tool allows business leaders to:

Explore churn patterns in real-time.

Filter the data by customer segments like contract type, internet service, and tenure.

Drill down into the specific reasons customers are leaving.

3. Key Analytical Insights
The analysis revealed three key insights that tell a clear story:

Insight #1: The problem is concentrated in two main groups. Customers on Month-to-Month contracts and those with Fiber Optic internet service both churn at a rate of over 40%, far higher than the company average of 26.5%.

Insight #2: Price is not the issue, value is. A deeper dive into the Fiber Optic group revealed a surprising fact: the customers who churned were often paying less than the customers who stayed. This suggests the issue isn't the price, but the "value for money" of the service.

Insight #3: The entry-level plan is failing. The problem is most severe for customers on the cheapest, low-tier Fiber Optic plans (those paying less than $70/month). This group has an unsustainable churn rate of over 62%.

4. Recommendations for the Business
Based on these insights, I have two data-backed recommendations:

Recommendation #1: Re-evaluate the entry-level Fiber Optic plan. The business needs to investigate why this plan is underperforming. A market analysis of competitor offers at this price point is crucial to see if the service is uncompetitive in terms of speed, data caps, or reliability.

Recommendation #2: Develop a targeted retention campaign. The company should proactively target customers in the high-risk segments (Month-to-month and low-tier Fiber Optic) with incentives to switch to more stable yearly contracts or higher-value service plans.
